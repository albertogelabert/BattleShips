# BattleShips

This is a project I did in my first year of degree. 
It's a simple battle ships game, made with Java. Here you can find the documentation written in Catalan. 

EDIT: the project need to be reviewed, but since it's a university project I didn't put time on it yet. I want to refractor all the code to be easier to read for english speakers. Also the documentation has to be translated.
